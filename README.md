#### This app scrapes over 2000 posts from the r/worldnews subreddit and r/conspiracy subreddit, trains a naive bayes model on these post to help the model identify patterns behind traditional credible news post and headlines and those that are more likely to be stemming from conspiracy theories. The app then takes in new inputs from users and and predicts a classification based on the NLP's training set with a percentage likelyhood for either class. Please see the adjacent app.py doc for a technical review.
