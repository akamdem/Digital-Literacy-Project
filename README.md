#### This app scrapes over 5000 posts from the r/worldnews subreddit and r/conspiracy subreddit, trains a Na√Øve Bayes model on these posts to help the model identify patterns behind traditional credible news post/headlines and those that are more likely to be stemming from conspiracy theories. The app then takes in new inputs from users and predicts a classification based on the NLP model's training and returns a classigication with a percentage likelyhood for either class. Please see the adjacent app.py doc for a technical review.
